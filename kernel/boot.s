	#    are already disabled by the bootloader, so this is not needed. Mind
	#    that you might later enable interrupts and return from kernel_main

	# 2) Wait for the next interrupt to arrive with hlt (halt instruction).
	#    Since they are disabled, this will lock up the computer.

	#    non-maskable interrupt occurring or due to system management mode.
